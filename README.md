I'm just another skilled lowlevel programmer, preffered in Assembly(x86/x64) and C/C++.
Just working a bit on improving my lowlevel skills in operating systems and high efficient assembly programming.
I'm only working on Linux, preffered OpenSUSE or Debian. Since I found Linux, Windows has getten wierd for me.
